My process:
Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
Mobile-first workflow

What I learned:
After first attempting it two months ago and barely making a dent in it, I built this project today. I used a mobile-first approach and employed flexbox for the layout of this card. I tried to assign classes to as many elements as possible in order to style each individually. It's possible that my CSS isn't as dry as it could be for this reason, but it made things easier. 

I recently learned that it's important to set a background color in addition to a background image, in case the image doesn't load. Well, on this project, both are needed to replicate the original design.

Continued development:
I want to play more with box-shadow, as I couldn't quite get it to work the way I wanted it to on this project. At least, I couldn't get my card to match the original. I used flexbox for the .plan element, but I need to remember how to do the spacing on this when elements aren't all equally spaced.

Useful resources:
I used MDN pages and W3schools a few times to remind myself how to use certain properties.
